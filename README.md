### Retro-WoW DKP export tool
(Heavily) Based on the EP/GP export tool written by Luise

Currently only the absolute minimum to switch functionality for DKP has been implemented

### Usage
* Install addon
* use the command `/epgpexport` to export dkp values
* /reloadui is then required to save the export
* the export is then located at `WTF\Account\ACCOUNTNAME\SavedVariables\EPGPexport.lua` further exports will overwrite
